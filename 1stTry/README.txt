Density file contains how to calculate density which I believe useless.
Dk calculate Dk and Ki. Dk uses d = 3 and volume equals to the one coresponding to d. Use Dk-1 as a model. Use ki2 test for ki. Something is wrong with the phi, psi when you put the value. Maybe you can make it more efficient if I change the calculation method in ki and Dk.
Fcalc1 shows phi, psi, and F values to text file.
